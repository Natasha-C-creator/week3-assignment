Cookie Clicker Assignment

- Started by copying Joe's walking skeleton.
- Changed background in CSS file, tried to put all the div elements into a grid/rows.
- Went over the Fetch API workshop and created console.js to work on the workshop as a reminder.
- Started to apply the same logic from Fetch API workshop into the app.js file.
- I can see the returned JSON data in the console log.
- MANAGED TO GET THE API DATA TO SHOW ON THE PAGE!! (With, full disclosure, some help of google results nand Chat GPT to debug my code. It was useful to show that I was defining things too early and let me know if I'm missing (), {}, ; etc).
- Removed some divs from the index.html file as these were not needed
- I managed to get the boxes for the returned API data to span the entire width of the screen! It's only doing the button at the moment, but it's a start...
- Realised that it is probably showing all parts of the box at 100%, but because the words are short, they aren't spanning!
