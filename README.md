Cookie Clicker Assignment

Started by copying Joe's walking skeleton.
Changed background in CSS file, tried to put all the div elements into a grid/rows.
Went over the Fetch API workshop and created console.js to work on the workshop as a reminder.
Started to apply the same logic from Fetch API workshop into the app.js file.
I can see the returned JSON data in the console log.
